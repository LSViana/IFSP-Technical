To execute the exercises, copy the folder (for example "ex-1") to htdocs/ and the file index.php inside each folder to htdocs/ as well

The structure should look like this for ex-1:
htdocs/
	(other files)
	index.php (the one copied from ex-1/index.php)
	ex-1 (the folder)	

Any further questions, text me in lv201122@gmail.com
